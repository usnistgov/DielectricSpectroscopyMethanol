Analysis of lone molecule histories

The code track_lone_molec.m takes the identities of lone molecules produced from other code herein and the per-molecule values to generate the values per molecule o each lone molecule as well as the period of time that that molecule is not hydrogen bonded. Then, this code averages these values over cycles.
