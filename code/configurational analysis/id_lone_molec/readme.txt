Identification of lone molecules

The code id_lonemol.m takes the list of hydrogen bonds by molecule ID and determines which molecules are and are not hydrogen bound at each time step. This allows for the splitting of values into contributions to the lone molecule total and the hydrogen bound molecule total.
