GENERAL INFORMATION-------------------------------------------------

This folder contains input files for running a simulation using Tinker9 for methanol. The files include:

methanol.inp
methanol.key
methanol.prm
methanol.txyz

FILE METHANOL.INP ----------------------------------------------------

The file designated methanol.inp holds the information for Tinker9 regarding what to run and for how long. These inputs differ from the inputs expected by the Tinker8 program. For the Tinker9 program, these inputs contained in this file or otherwise expected as input are:

1- methanol.txyz      -> tinker-style xyz file containing initial configuration
2- methanol.prm      -> force field parameter information
3- number of simulation steps to perform
4- length of simulation steps in fs
5- frequency of output in ps
6- ensemble of simulation
            choices here are:
            1     ->    NVE 
            2     ->    NVT
            3     ->    NPH
            4     ->    NPT
7- Temperature of simulation in K
8- Pressure of simulation in atm

FILE METHANOL.KEY ----------------------------------------------------

The file designated methanol.key for each alcohol has additional information for Tinker9 about the run. This includes information such as the name of the file containing force field parameters; what to output; thermostats, barostats, and integrators; applied electrical fields; van der Waals and other types of cutoffs required for a given force field; and specifics of polarization algorithms in the case of the AMOEBA09 force field. Many of these inputs need not change as they reflect choices inherent to the AMOEBA09 force field. Some of the useful keywords we used are as follows:


Simulation specification keywords:

thermostat NOSE-HOOVER
       this keyword specifies use of the Nose-Hoover thermostat in simulations
barostat NOSE-HOOVER
        this keyword specifies use of the Nose-Hoover barostat in simulations
        NOTE: this line should be commented out when holding volume rather than pressure constant in a simulation
integrator VERLET
        this keyword specifies use of the Verlet integration algorithm in simulations

External electric field keywords:
        
external-field 0.0 0.0 1.0
        this keyword specifies that an electric field is to be applied in the simulation
        following the keyword are the values for the strength of the field in the x, y, and z directions respectively in units of MV/cm
exfld-freq 1.0
        this keyword provides additional information regarding an externally applied electric field in simulations by setting a frequency of the field in GHz
        NOTE: if this keyword is absent, the applied field will be constant (i.e., will not vary sinusoidally)

System output keywords:
        
archive
        this keyword tells tinker to output the configuration (i.e., the position of each atom) to a file named *.arc after the input file *.txyz with frequency specified in the *.inp file
save-induced
        this keyword tells tinker to output not only the atomic positions but also the induced polarization of each atom to a file named *.uind with frequency specified in the *.inp file
save-ustatic
        this keyword tells tinker to output the static polarization of each atom to a file named *.ustc with frequency specified in the *.inp file
save-usystem
        this keyword tells tinker to output the total simulation box static and induced polarization as well as the total static and induced polarization of each tinker type in the simulation to the standard output of tinker (not to a separate file)
save-velocity
        this keyword tells tinker to output the velocity of each atom to a file named *.vel with frequency specified in the *.inp file
save-vsystem
        this keyword is analogous to the save-usystem keyword for polarization
        this keyword tells tinker to output the total system velocity as well as the total velocity of each tinker type in the simulation to the standard output of tinker (not to a separate file)
nocoord
        this keyword allows the user to use archive functions of tinker to print other types of output (like the *.ustc and *.uind file or just the polarization information to standard output) without also printing the position of each atom

FILE METHANOL.TXYZ -------------------------------------------------------

The file methanol.txyz contains an initial configuration generated by packmol containing 500 molecules of methanol. This file cannot be directly generated by packmol because packmol generates conventional xyz files. A conventional xyz file will have the general structure

The tinker xyz file is structured instead like so

Before the elemental symbol, the number of the atom is indicated. After the position of the atom, the tinker type (corresponding to a listing in the *.prm file) is listed, followed by the number of the atoms bound to the given atom.

OUTPUT TINKER FILES ------------------------------------------------------

The output files generated by tinker are structured in the same way as the *.txyz tinker xyz file, except that in place of position there can also be reported the static polarization, induced polarization, and velocity. These are contained in the files:

*.ustc    ->   static polarization
*.uind    ->   induced polarization
*.vel     ->   velocity
